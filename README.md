# Covid-19-Analysis

## Overview  
This project analyzes the current COVID-19 situation across various countries, focusing on total cases, deaths, recoveries, active cases, serious cases, and testing metrics. The data is compiled and presented to provide insights into the pandemic's impact and the effectiveness of health measures implemented worldwide. This project presents an interactive dashboard for visualizing COVID-19 data. The dashboard features a variety of visualization types, including pie charts, donut charts, bar charts, and line charts, alongside informative cards that summarize key statistics.  


## Introduction  
The COVID-19 pandemic has affected millions of lives globally. This project aims to offer a comprehensive overview of the pandemic's status by comparing data from different countries. Emphasis is placed on understanding patterns and identifying areas requiring attention.In light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, this project aims to provide an accessible tool for users to explore the impact of the virus across different countries. The dashboard allows for real-time data visualization and updates, catering to researchers, policymakers, and the general public.  

## Analysis  
- The United States leads in total cases (over 5 million) and deaths (approximately 162,804), with significant recovery figures (around 2.57 million).  
- Active cases in the U.S. stand at approximately 2.29 million, and serious or critical cases are reported at 18,296.  
- The U.S. also has conducted over 63 million tests, while Russia shows a high testing rate with approximately 203,623 tests per million population.  
- Active cases are incresed onwards March

## Conclusion  
This analysis reveals the ongoing challenges presented by COVID-19, particularly in the United States. High active cases and serious cases necessitate continued public health efforts and international cooperation to mitigate the pandemic's impact.The data and visualizations highlight the USA's significant burden of COVID-19 in terms of total cases, deaths, and testing efforts. Other countries like Brazil, India, and Russia also show substantial numbers but vary in aspects like testing per million and critical cases. This analysis underscores the global disparity in the pandemic's impact and response, reflecting differences in healthcare capacity, testing rates, and population size.
